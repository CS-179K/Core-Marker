____ user stories ____

"As an active user I want to contact the developers so I can give feedback or report problems about the App. Story points 2, Priority 8"
This is a great feature.
User feedback on products is quite valuable, and it's generally left as an afterthought.

____ sprint board ____

Generally we only place the stories we intended to finish on a sprint board.
// Rather than all of them

tasks/tests:
"Testing "
Finding the right level of detail for tasks can be rather difficult.
// It looks a bit like y'all are not actually using the sprint board for your planning.
// Documenting things one way and doing them another uncommon.
// And for a project of this size it's probably easier as well.
//
// It's interesting that planning in sprints is done before one has actually started prototyping at all.
// As far as I can tell unless one has done a similar project before breaking things into tasks feels fairly arbitrary.
// I suppose it comes with practice, and even with practice plans can fall apart pretty quick.



____ conc. ____

Looks good.
By the end of Thursday's lab we're going to want a DB Scheme (for anything related to your first sprint), and UI wireframe.
