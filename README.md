# Core Marker

## About: 
This is a Web app called “Core Marker” where people can write about their personal experiences within their local communities or around the world. A place for people to leave behind their memories that others can read across the Internet through their posts with/without photos to share. A place for people to reminisce or discover what communities or local public areas have occurred over time. A place where people can leave a historical record online that otherwise would have been dismissed in people’s history of daily life.
